                        <p>Mentora is built on advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4, which have been trained on vast amounts of text data. However, it does not "think" or "understand" like a humanâ€”it predicts words and phrases based on patterns rather than genuine comprehension. This means:</p>
                        <ul class="tips-list">
                            <li>It may misinterpret complex, vague, or ambiguous questions.</li>

                            <li>It cannot independently verify the latest news or updates unless explicitly programmed to do so.</li>

If you ask questions unrelated to the app's subject matter or its practice question, responses may be irrelevant, incomplete, or incorrect.</p>
                        <p>Mentora does not replace external resources, such as official textbooks, real-world expert advice, or professional consultations.</p>
                        <p>If a topic is outside its training data, it may try to generate a response based on similar concepts, which can lead to inaccuracies.</p>
